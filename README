HTML5 Robot User Interface

Installation (Debian/Ubuntu/Mint):

1. Install nodejs, npm:
	$ sudo apt-get install nodejs npm

   NOTE: On older systems (i.e. 32-Bit, Debian), nodejs-legacy package may also be required.

2. Install MongoDB (http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/):

	$ sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv 7F0CEB10
	$ echo 'deb http://downloads-distro.mongodb.org/repo/ubuntu-upstart dist 10gen' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb.list
	$ sudo apt-get update
	$ sudo apt-get install -y mongodb-org
	$ sudo service mongod start

   To check if mongodb was installed correctly, run mongo:
	$ mongo

   Configure MongoDB:
     //In Construction.

3. Open HTML5RUI-master directory.

4. install app:
	$ npm install

5. run app:
	$ npm start

6. Install avconv (Optional, required for video streaming):
	$ sudo apt-get install libav-tools

Note on using port 80:
	The app is setup to use port 80 by default.
	Using standard HTTP Port 80 requires root privileges.
	If user is not root, an EACCES error will be thrown on app start (using sudo will work, but is a security risk).
	To use a different port (greater than 1024), Open app.js and modify line 2 to the desired Port (should not be the same as FFMPEGPORT or WSPORT),save changes and restart app if necessary.
	The server can then be reached at:
		http://localhost:XXXX/ 
	where XXXX is the chosen PORT. (i.e. for PORT=8100; http://localhost:8100)


	There are several ways to use or redirect Port 80 without root privileges:

Installation (Windows):

The server is meant to be deployed on Linux. It can be installed on Windows, but it's not recommended as installation is cumbersome (not of the app itself, dependencies) and some features aren't available (Live Video for example, requires dev/videoN devices, not available on windows).

1. Install NodeJS from http://nodejs.org/ . Make sure NPM package manager is installed (it is by default).

2. Install MongoDB from http://www.mongodb.org/downloads

3. Configure MongoDB: In construction.

4. Install HTML5RUI:
	Open cmd in HTML5RUI directory.
		>npm install

	(Optional) Install app as windows service (daemonize and keep running):
		Install node-windows (globally):
			>npm install -g node-windows
		Open cmd in HTML5RUI/utils.
			>node winsvc install name
			(where "name" is the name the service will have/has)
		Other actions:
			>node winsvc uninstall name
			>node winsvc start name
			>node winsvc stop name

5. Run app manually (if not installed as service):
	Open cmd in HTML5RUI directory:
		>npm start

Possible issues with Windows installation:
	npm error when trying to install (missing folder npm): Create folder manually (normally in AppData/Roaming/npm).
	MongoDB error (missing data/db/): Create folder manually where the database will be stored (use of MongoDB installation folder recommended).
	npm, node, mongod and mongo should be in your PATH if you don't want to specify it each time you use them.
